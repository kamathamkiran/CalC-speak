## Acknowledgements:

TheVoice Calculator project would like to acknowledge the following resources and libraries:
* we created a new SpeechSynthesisUtterance object and set the text property to the input string. Then, we use the speak() method from the SpeechSynthesis API to speak the text aloud. 
* Note that this code relies on the browser's built-in text-to-speech functionality, so it may not work in all environments.
* Make sure to run this code in a browser environment that supports the SpeechSynthesis API.
